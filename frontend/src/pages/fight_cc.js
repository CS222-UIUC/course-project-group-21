          So what can you do?
        </h1> 
        <h4>1. Pressure, pressure, pressure</h4>
        <p>
          The most important part of public change is public participation.
          Join organizations like Count Us In, which aims to inspire 1 billion people to challenge their leaders to act more boldly on climate.
          Another option is to join the UN&apos;s #ActNow campaign on climate change and sustainability.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Change your transpotation</h4>
        <p>
          Electric Cars are becoming increasingly common, but a cheaper alternative is to simply walk or buy a bike.
          Carpool is another option to lower the overall amount of cars on the road.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Lower spending</h4>
        <p>
          An even simpler choice would be lowering consumption of things like electricity, heating, clothing, and diet.
          Installing solar panels, switching to LED lights, and improving your home&apos;s insulation are all valid ways to decrease your impact on the environment.
          As for the consumption side of things, eco-friendly products, foods, and eco-friendly investments.
